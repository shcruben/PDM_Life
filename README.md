How to make the first push of stuff to git:
on the directory you wish to manage your project


git init
git add ./*                                   # (This adds the stuff you want to commit)
git commit -m "This is my boring commit"      # This tells git that you want to keep your changes on your local repo... i guess
git remote add origin *The link to the git repo*             
git config --global user.email "your@email.com"
git config --global user.name "Your Name"
git push origin master                        # this pushes the files you added and commited to your local repo changes to master
